My game is focused on the theme of the city, you incarned a wanderer inside a giant urban environment. It is undefined in time and space but humans used to live in those buildings a long time before.

List of interactions :
- Open a door with a button
- Listen to an audio log
- Manipulate some levers to unlock a door (you have to find the good combination in order to unlock the door)
- Put an energy cell back into its plug so that it provides electricity to open a locked door
